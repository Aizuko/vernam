# Working on Vernam

Vernam was called Signal GPUI (the repository was knpwrs/signal-gpui), then Ziggy (knpwrs/ziggy), and lives at knpwrs/vernam; the cargo package and the `SIGNAL_GPUI_*` environment variables keep the first name. A new former name goes in `former_name::FORMER`, newest first.

Lessons from building this client and from its code reviews. README.md covers what the app does; this covers how to change it without repeating old mistakes.

## Signal Desktop is the reference

When behavior is in question (what a read sync marks, how a reaction finds its target, what a backup field means), read Signal Desktop's source and do what it does. Cite the file in a comment (`ts/util/safetyNumber`, `ts/messageModifiers/ReadSyncs`). `.signal-desktop-hash` names the last Desktop commit Vernam has been checked against; the `desktop-parity` skill (`.claude/skills/desktop-parity`) catches up from there and moves it forward. Guessing from the protocol alone produced most of the real-account bugs:

- **Edited messages answer to every edit's timestamp.** Reactions, receipts and read syncs for an edited message name the latest edit, not the original. `message_edits` records each edit's timestamp and lookups match it. A transferred backup dates an edited message by its latest revision; the original date is the oldest revision's.
- **A read sync reads everything older in its chat**, and one that arrives before its message is kept and applied when the message does. Marking only the named message left chats unread.
- **Link and sync sends more than chats and messages.** The backup also lists installed sticker packs, and each attachment's transit-tier locator. Read every frame type before deciding one doesn't matter.

## presage caches things forever

presage stores the first profile, profile photo and group photo it downloads and never refreshes them. Anything that can change needs a fresh fetch: `profiles.rs` asks the server for the current avatar path, and `refresh_group_avatar` compares the group's avatar path. Name saved files after the remote path (hashed), so a changed path means a new download. Profile fetches are rate limited: check each person at most daily and cap each sync, as Desktop's routine profile refresh does.

## Several accounts

The app runs every account at once, each with its own backend thread, database, key (`database-key.<id>` in the Keychain; the first account keeps `database-key`) and directory (`accounts/<id>/`). Anything process-wide is shared by all of them, so it must be per account or follow the account on screen:

- `remote_config::current()` is the backend thread's own account's config (a thread-local the backend installs). The interface reads `AppState::remote_config()`, never a global, and functions it calls take the config.
- One notification center serves every account: `AccountNotifier` prefixes ids and threads with the account, and the Dock's badge adds them up.
- Theme and zoom are account settings; only the shown account's apply (`AppState::shown`). `window_active` means the window is in front *and* shows that account, which is what reading chats and suppressing notifications need.
- Calls: `CallLines` tells each backend whether another account is in a call, so it answers "busy".

## Database

- **Every store transaction starts with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`** (`AppDb::write`). A deferred transaction that reads and then writes fails at once with "database is locked" when another connection committed in between; the busy timeout doesn't apply. This aborted a history import while messages were arriving.
- **Writes queue for one connection.** `AppDb` has a read pool and a writer pool of one connection; every write, a transaction or a single statement, goes through `writer`. Writes from two connections race for SQLite's lock, and the loser fails with "database is locked" after the 5-second busy timeout: a reaction, a receipt and an incoming message were lost that way. The read pool's connections are `query_only`, so a write sent to `pool` by mistake fails at once, and the store's tests run on disk with both pools to catch it.
- **Keep each write transaction short**, since everything else waits behind it: commit per item rather than holding the lock across a long loop, and make sure each statement in a loop uses an index (check with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`). `rename_authors` once scanned every message twice per person, 1 to 3 seconds a scan, all in one transaction. `json_extract` lookups need an expression index.
- **Migrations are squashed into one init.** Changing the init changes its checksum, and sqlx refuses a database whose applied migration changed, so any change to the init needs a path in `adopt_squashed_history` for databases made by the previous init. Before adding a migration, check whether a JSON field with `#[serde(default)]` or a `settings` row will do: attachment locators and verified identity keys needed no migration.
- **The history import is not one transaction** and runs alongside the receive loop. Once it starts, nothing may cancel it, and a failure leaves a partial import that is marked done.

## Privacy and the user's account

- Never use the user's messages, contacts, screenshots or photos as test data or demo content. The demo's people are made up and its images are drawn in code.
- The user's real account runs from `target/release/Vernam.app` (`Ziggy.app` until the user rebuilds after the rename). Don't kill it, don't build release over it, and don't touch its data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/io.github.knpwrs.Vernam`, before that `io.github.knpwrs.Ziggy` and `org.signal-gpui.Signal-GPUI`) except to read logs or databases when asked. Opening a database needs the Keychain key, which prompts the user. Any `vernam` run without `SIGNAL_GPUI_DATA_DIR`, debug included, is also the real account, and the first one moves the newest former name's data directory to Vernam's (`former_name.rs`).
- Screenshot only windows of a process you started (match by PID). Never send synthetic input. A window on another Space doesn't draw; wait for it rather than activating it.
- Don't ship Signal's Giphy key.

## Testing and screenshots

- `SIGNAL_GPUI_DEMO=1` runs with seeded demo data and no network. Several UI tests read demo names and messages, so change `demo.rs` and those tests together.
- **Always pair `SIGNAL_GPUI_DEMO=1` with `SIGNAL_GPUI_DATA_DIR=<a scratch directory>`.** The demo flag changes only the backend, not where data lives. Without a data dir, any build (debug included) opens the real profile with the Keychain key and seeds demo data into it. A 20-second run did that: `seed_profiles` cleared every username in `profiles`, overwrote `account.username` and `account.username_link`, and added demo profiles, a badge and files; the window also showed real chats and photos. Before capturing anything, check the log's `data directory:` line names the scratch directory. If it doesn't, kill the process.
- Headless GPUI tests (`#[gpui_kit::test]` with the demo backend) only see backend events if the test pumps them into `AppState` as `main.rs` does.
- To preview a state you can't click to (a dialog, a loading screen), patch the demo to emit it, capture, and restore the file. Keep a backup and confirm the patch is gone afterwards.
- Optimize README images with `oxipng -o max --strip safe`.

## Reviews and commits

- **Before committing, review and fix in a loop, at most five rounds.** Review a whole change once it's done and its tests pass, not each small step, and split it into atomic commits afterwards by staging hunks. Each round:
  1. A fresh `general-purpose` subagent (a new one each round, so it reads the code fresh) runs `/code-review high --max-findings default` over the whole change (the working tree, or `<base>...HEAD` plus the working tree if part of it is already committed), plus `/security-review` in round 1 when the change touches crypto, keys, the Keychain, untrusted input (incoming messages, backups, attachments, file paths), SQL built from data, or dependencies. It only reports: no edits, commits or comments. Don't review the same diff yourself meanwhile.
  2. Judge each finding against the code, and keep a ledger of every finding judged (location, gist, verdict, round). One that matches a ledger entry, even reworded or moved, is a repeat: don't reopen it unless its fix demonstrably didn't work. Fix correctness bugs, real vulnerabilities, missed edge cases and missing tests, and in round 1 also cheap, clear improvements. Skip false positives, out-of-scope suggestions and, after round 1, cleanup, simplification and efficiency suggestions, each with a stated reason. Collect anything that changes the design or scope and ask about it once, at the end.
  3. From round 2, this overrides step 2 for code the loop itself wrote: a finding there is worth fixing only if it's a correctness bug or a real vulnerability, not a missed edge case or a missing test.
  4. Stop when nothing new is worth fixing. `/code-review` always finds something, so a round of repeats and skips is a clean round, not a reason to go again. Otherwise fix, run the tests for what changed (and check runtime changes in the demo), and start the next round.
- Don't run `cargo fmt`: the code isn't rustfmt-formatted, and it rewrites nearly every file in the crate.
- Findings that came up again and again:
  - Don't consume queued state (an early read sync, a pending download) until the work it stands for succeeded.
  - Don't record side data for an update that didn't apply, such as an edit timestamp for an edit to a deleted message.
  - Don't decide what a file is by sniffing its bytes when the stored content type says. A file must never go through the image optimizer.
  - Bound network work per run and schedule the rest, rather than issuing hundreds of requests at once.
  - Report every reason something was skipped, not only the common one.
- Make atomic commits, one per change, and check each builds and passes on its own. Stage hunks, then build in a separate `git worktree` with its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; `git stash --keep-index` conflicts on pop when a file is partly staged.
- The repository pushes as the `knpwrs` GitHub account through the `github-knpwrs` SSH host alias.

## Noise in the logs

- `could not create sync message from a group message` (libsignal-service) is logged whenever something other than a message or edit, such as a typing indicator, goes to a group. It's harmless.
- `trusting new identity` appears as sessions with contacts start after linking.

## Writing

README and comment prose follows the user's no-slop rules: no em dashes, concrete details instead of claims, and no padding. Say what was tested and what wasn't.
